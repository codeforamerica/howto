Python Virtual Environments
====

Pip and Virtualenv are the packaging tools recommended by the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/current.html). Use Pip to install Python packages from [PyPI](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-python-package-index-pypi), and virtualenv to isolate application specific dependencies from a shared Python installation.

Pip

To install Pip on a Mac OS, [follow the Pip installer instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html):

> Install or Upgrade pip
> To install or upgrade pip, securely download [get-pip.py](https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py). [[1](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#id5)]
> 
> Then run the following (which may require administrator access):
> 
>     $ python get-pip.py
> 
> If setuptools (or distribute) is not already installed, get-pip.py will install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) for you. [[2](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#id6)]

On Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora Linux, Pip is available under the name `python-pip`.

> On Debian and Ubuntu:
> 
>     $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
> 
> On Fedora:
> 
>     $ sudo yum install python-pip

Virtualenv
---

Install Virtualenv tools.

    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

Create a new virtualenv folder, in your local project directory.

    $ mkdir venv-project-name
    $ virtualenv venv-project-name

Activate the environment.

 * `$ source venv-project-name/bin/activate` (if you use the bash shell)
 * `$ source venv-project-name/bin/activate.csh` (if you use the csh or tcsh)

Now `which pip` should confirm that your pip executable is located under *venv-project-name*.

When you're done working with your virtual environment, it is easy to get out.

    $ deactivate

Install Packages
---

If you are installing an existing project, look for a [requirements.txt](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.1/requirements.html) file containing names of packages required by the project. Ask Pip to install the list of packages.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
