How To Do Things With Computers

Simple guides to foundational tech tasks for Code for America projects.

The guides here serve two purposes:

1. Code for America software documentation should **link here for common tasks** like setting up a dev environment or framework. We prefer a tightly-edited, central collection of the most common tasks to everyone re-writing their own versions.
2. Guides here should be normative, describing the simplest, lowest-friction ways of getting common things done. If your app or library doesnâ€™t work with the directions here, consider whether you can **modify your app so that it works** rather than making a change to a guide.
